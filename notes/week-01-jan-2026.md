- [x] **Learning:** Video 1 - Welcome to Machine Learning (~8 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 2 - Applications of Machine Learning (~10 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Set up Coursera account, bookmark course
- **Notes:**
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min

### Friday, January 2
**Target:** Videos 3-4 (30 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 3 - What is Machine Learning? (~7 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 4 - Supervised Learning Part 1 (~12 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Take notes on supervised learning definition
- **Notes:**
-Supervised - give input and output, e.g, spam/not spam, malignant/benign, etc... can classify or categorize data.
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min

### Saturday, January 3
**Target:** Videos 5-6 (30 min)

## Weekly Summary
**Total time:** 120 / 150 min (2.5 hrs)
**Videos completed:** 8/ 10
**Labs completed:** 1 / 1
**Quizzes completed:** 1 / 1

**Key learnings:**
- Supervised is giving inputs with answers, unsupervised is having machines look at data to categorize or find anomalies in the data. Jupyter notebooks are collections of markdown and python code to train models.

**Blockers/Challenges:**
- The Jupyter lab was one sheet?

**Next week focus:**
