## Daily Log

### Monday, January 5
**Target:** Videos 11-12 (30 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 11 - Cost Function Formula (~10 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 12 - Cost Function Intuition (~15 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Sketch cost function graph
- **Notes:**
- Cost function = function of difference between observed versus actual reduced by M the number of observations
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min

### Tuesday, January 6
**Target:** Videos 13-14 (30 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 13 - Visualizing the Cost Function (~8 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 14 - Visualization Examples (~12 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Optional Lab - Cost Function
- **Notes:**
- Cost function is a U shaped curve when b is removed and only solved for w, when B is added the u becomes 3 dimensional J(w,b), b, and w
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min

### Wednesday, January 7
**Target:** Videos 15-16 (30 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 15 - Gradient Descent (~10 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 16 - Implementing Gradient Descent (~12 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Write pseudocode for gradient descent
- **Notes:**
- In other regressions outside of linear, you get a 3d model of hills and valleys, starting at top of hill spin 360 to find baby step that will be biggest reduction from height you are at, repeat until bottom of valley. There may be multiple valleys depending on start point, these are local minima.
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min

### Thursday, January 8
**Target:** Videos 17-18 (30 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 17 - Gradient Descent Intuition (~10 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 18 - Learning Rate (~12 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Optional Lab - Gradient Descent
- **Notes:**
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min

### Friday, January 9
**Target:** Videos 19-20 + Lab (30 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 19 - Gradient Descent for Linear Regression (~8 min)
- [x] **Learning:** Video 20 - Running Gradient Descent (~5 min)
- [x] **Hands-on:** Optional Lab - Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
- **Notes:**
- **Time spent:** 30 / 30 min
